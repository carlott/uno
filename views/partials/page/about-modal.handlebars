                <p>Each game can have 2 to 9 players.</p>
                <p>The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved 
                  (usually over several rounds of play) by a player discarding all of their 
                  cards and earning points corresponding to the value of the remaining cards 
                  still held by the other players.
                </p>
                <p>The deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are 25 of each color (red, 
                  green, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero. The 
                  ranks in each color are zero to nine, "Skip", "Draw Two", and "Reverse" (the 
                  last three being "action cards"). In addition, the deck contains four each of 
                  "Wild" and "Wild Draw Four" cards.
                </p>
                <p>When the game begins, seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of 
                  the deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player who
                  created the game plays first. On a player's turn, they must do one 
                  of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>play a card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol</li>
                  <li>play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card (see restriction below)</li>
                  <li>draw the top card of the deck</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Play proceeds clockwise around the table when the game begins.</p>
                <P>Action and Wild cards have the following effects:</P>

                <ul>
                  <li>If a player draws a card that is playable, the player has the option of 
                    either keeping it or playing it immediately. Having drawn from the deck, the 
                    player will not use any other card from their hand on that turn.</li>
                  <li>A player may play a Wild card at any time, even if that player has other 
                    playable cards.</li>
                  <li>A player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards 
                    matching the current color. The player may have cards of a different color 
                    matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild 
                    Draw Four card.</li>
                  <li>If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and 
                    the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. Play then proceeds 
                    normally.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>A player who makes a play to leave oneself with 1 card remaining must call 
                  "Uno" as a warning to the other players.</p>
                <p>The first player to get rid of their last card ("going out") wins the hand 
                  and scores points for the cards held by the other players. Number cards count 
                  their face value, all action cards count 20, and Wild and Wild Draw Four 
                  cards count 50. If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, 
                  the next player in sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before 
                  the score is tallied.</p>
                <p>The first player to score 500 points wins the game.</p>
                <h4>Penalties</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>If a player lays down their next-to-last card without calling "Uno", two
                    cards will be drawn to the player.</li>
